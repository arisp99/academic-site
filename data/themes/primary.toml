# Obsidian primary theme. I have included her original description of the theme

# ✦ P R I M A R Y ✦
# Obsidian Theme by Cecilia May
# ────────────────────────────────────
# A combination of Bauhaus, Scandinavian
# and yellowing magazine pages as palette
# inspiration—Primary is a theme for people
# looking for a certain nostalgic warmness.
# It is toppled with functional pop
# of red blue yellow colors.
# The perfect mix of loud and reserved.
# Playful, reminiscing, productive.
